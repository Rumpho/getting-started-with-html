  <b>What I learned about the <em>WWW</em> and <em>HTML</em></b><br>
<p>In this introductory section I learned some of the basics of the <em>World Wide Web</em>, what <em>HTML</em> (HyperText Markup Language) is, and that it is the main type of document on the web. I now also better understand what tags are and, for the first time, learned about attributes. More details are provided below.</p>
<p>I understand that I access the internet through my computer browser (Chrome, in my case) and the internet in turn accesses information from servers; information written in <em>HTML</em>. We see the finished text on our screens, but the information also contains all the mark-ups, refs to other docs, <em>e.g.</em>, images and video, and links to other pages.</p>
<p>Markup tags typically have an opening and closing tag, but there are also void tags, <em>e.g.</em>, the line break, br, and image tag, img, which do not have or need a closing tag. There are inline tags such as b, em, a, span and img. There are also block tags such as p and div.</p><p></p> I was especially pleased to learn that extra character spaces and extra white lines are automatically removed in the final text! I am perplexed by what the attribute src really means with the image tag, but I also learned that programmers can't remember everything and I probably can just look this up. </p>
